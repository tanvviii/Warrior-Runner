# Warrior-Runner Game in Python - Terminal Based

## Why is implementing Warrior Runner harder than implementing Tetris?

Warrior Runner offers a more dynamic and visually engaging experience compared to Tetris. While Tetris is a timeless puzzle game focused on logic and spatial reasoning, Warrior Runner features action-packed gameplay with animated characters, enemy interactions, and real-time controls. It allows players to actively control a character, making it feel more immersive. For game developers, Warrior Runner is a better learning tool as it involves working with animations, collisions, sound, and modular code — offering more creative possibilities and expansion potential than the simpler mechanics of Tetris.

## *Project Modeling in Warrior-Runner*

Based on the GitHub repository shared (Warrior-Runner), here’s how things appear to be modeled in this 2D endless runner game:

### Core Game Elements

#### *Player Character*
•⁠  ⁠Modeled as a warrior with running, jumping, and attacking animations.
•⁠  ⁠Likely implemented as a sprite with physics properties (rigidbody, colliders).

#### *Obstacles/Enemies*
•⁠  ⁠Various obstacles that the player must jump over or attack.
•⁠  ⁠Probably implemented as prefabs with colliders for interaction detection.

#### *Environment*
•⁠  ⁠Parallax scrolling background layers.
•⁠  ⁠Ground segments that generate procedurally as the player runs.

---

### Technical Modeling

#### *Game States*
•⁠  ⁠Menu state.
•⁠  ⁠Playing state.
•⁠  ⁠Game over state.
•⁠  ⁠Pause state.

#### *Movement System*
•⁠  ⁠Player movement (running forward automatically).
•⁠  ⁠Jump mechanics (likely using Unity's physics system).
•⁠  ⁠Attack animations and hit detection.

#### *Scoring/Progress*
•⁠  ⁠Distance-based scoring.
•⁠  ⁠Possibly coin/collectible system.

#### *Object Pooling*
•⁠  ⁠For efficient obstacle/enemy generation and recycling.

### *Key Challenges in Warrior Runner* : 

1. *Increasing Speed Over Time*
 - The game's speed ramps up as the player survives longer, reducing reaction time and increasing difficulty progressively.

2. *Obstacle Timing & Coordination*
  - Players must jump or avoid obstacles (like cacti or other objects) with precise timing. Missteps mean immediate failure.

3. *Limited Player Control*
  - With only basic inputs (jump/run), the game tests reflexes and not strategy. It's a pure test of timing and focus.

4. *No Power-ups or Saves*
  - There are no boosters, lives, or checkpoints. One mistake means restarting, adding pressure and tension.

5. *Endless Nature*
  - The game has no defined end. It's all about survival time and high score, pushing players into a loop of self-competition.

6. *Minimal Visual Cues*
  - Inspired by the minimalistic T-Rex aesthetic, this design means you rely entirely on twitch reflexes—no fancy HUDs or warnings.

## 🛠️*Code Architecture*

The game is encapsulated within a class named ⁠ Game ⁠, which includes both the game state and its operations. It manages the main game loop, event handling, rendering, and updates for all components such as the player, obstacles, and power-ups. The architecture is modular, with dedicated managers for obstacles and power-ups, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### *Core Data Members*

•⁠  ⁠⁠ Warrior player ⁠ – Represents the main character of the game with attributes like position and type.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ ObstacleManager obstacle_manager ⁠ – Manages obstacles, including their creation, updates, and collisions.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ PowerUpManager power_up_manager ⁠ – Handles power-ups, their spawning, activation, and duration.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ int lives_left ⁠ – Tracks the number of lives the player has left (starts at 3).
•⁠  ⁠⁠ int score ⁠ – Keeps track of the current score during gameplay.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ int best_score ⁠ – Stores the highest score achieved across all game sessions.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ float game_speed ⁠ – Determines the movement speed of objects, increases as score rises.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ list heart_vec ⁠ – Stores the current heart images to visually represent lives on the screen.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ list x_pos_bg ⁠ – X-axis positions for parallax background layers to create scrolling effects.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ pygame.Surface screen ⁠ – Game window where all rendering is performed.

### *Core Functions*

| Function         | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ⁠ execute() ⁠      | Starts the main menu loop and initializes the game. |
| ⁠ run() ⁠          | Begins the gameplay loop, handling events, updates, and rendering. |
| ⁠ reset() ⁠        | Resets game variables like lives, score, and speed. |
| ⁠ events() ⁠       | Processes user inputs and system events (e.g., quit). |
| ⁠ update() ⁠       | Updates the state of the player, obstacles, power-ups, and score. |
| ⁠ update_score() ⁠ | Increments the score and adjusts game speed at milestones. |
| ⁠ update_heart() ⁠ | Updates the visual representation of lives left. |
| ⁠ draw_text() ⁠    | Renders text on the screen at specified positions. |
| ⁠ draw_score() ⁠   | Displays the current score with a shadow effect. |
| ⁠ draw_hearts_left() ⁠ | Draws heart icons to represent remaining lives. |
| ⁠ draw_power_up_time() ⁠ | Displays the remaining duration of active power-ups. |
| ⁠ draw() ⁠         | Handles rendering of all game elements (background, player, obstacles, etc.). |
| ⁠ parallax() ⁠     | Implements parallax scrolling for multi-layered backgrounds. |
| ⁠ show_menu() ⁠    | Displays the start or game-over menu based on game state. |
| ⁠ handle_events_on_menu() ⁠ | Processes menu-specific events like starting or quitting the game. |

## *Data Structures used in Project*

The game utilizes several fundamental data structures to manage game objects, state, and rendering. Here's a breakdown:

## *1. Lists (Arrays)*
•⁠  ⁠*Primary Purpose*: Storing and managing multiple game objects
•⁠  ⁠*Key Uses*:
  - ⁠ self.heart_vec = [HEARTS[0]] * 3 ⁠ - Tracks lives (hearts) as a list of images
  - ⁠ self.x_pos_bg = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ⁠ - Stores positions for parallax background layers
  - Obstacle and power-up collections in ⁠ ObstacleManager ⁠ and ⁠ PowerUpManager ⁠ classes

## *2. Dictionaries*
•⁠  ⁠*Primary Purpose*: Mapping keys to values for efficient lookups
•⁠  ⁠*Key Uses*:
  - Image/sound resources (constants like ⁠ HEARTS ⁠, ⁠ SCORE ⁠, etc.)
  - Power-up type mappings (likely used internally in ⁠ PowerUpManager ⁠)

## *3. Classes (Custom Objects)*
•⁠  ⁠*Primary Purpose*: Organizing game entities and logic
•⁠  ⁠*Key Classes*:
  - ⁠ Warrior ⁠ - Player character with state (position, power-ups, etc.)
  - ⁠ ObstacleManager ⁠ - Handles obstacle spawning/updating using lists
  - ⁠ PowerUpManager ⁠ - Manages power-up spawns and effects

## *4. Queues (Conceptual)*
•⁠  ⁠*Primary Purpose*: Managing object spawn timing
•⁠  ⁠*Implementation*:
  - Obstacles and power-ups spawn sequentially (though not a formal queue structure)
  - Event timing uses ⁠ pygame.time.get_ticks() ⁠

## *5. State Variables (Primitives)*
•⁠  ⁠*Primary Purpose*: Tracking game conditions
•⁠  ⁠*Examples*:
  - ⁠ self.score ⁠ (integer)
  - ⁠ self.game_speed ⁠ (integer)
  - ⁠ self.playing ⁠ (boolean)

## *Why These Structures?*
•⁠  ⁠*Lists*: Ideal for dynamic collections needing frequent iteration (e.g., drawing all obstacles)
•⁠  ⁠*Dictionaries*: Efficient lookups for resources/configuration
•⁠  ⁠*Classes*: Encapsulation of game object logic (player, enemies, etc.)
•⁠  ⁠*No complex structures needed*: The game's simplicity avoids trees/graphs

The design focuses on *O(1) access* for critical operations (e.g., player input) and *O(n) iteration* for rendering/updating objects—a optimal tradeoff for a 2D runner.

## 📊 Sample Gameplay Screenshots

### 🧩 Initial Game Grid

The Warrior-Runner game is a side-scrolling endless runner, not based on a grid system. Instead, it uses pixel-based coordinates to manage player and obstacle positions on a continuous horizontal plane. Screen dimensions define the playable area, and all movement is smooth and continuous, not tile-based.
