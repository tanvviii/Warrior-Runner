# Warrior-Runner Game in C++ - Terminal Based

## Why is implementing 2048 harder than implementing Tetris?

Warrior Runner offers a more dynamic and visually engaging experience compared to Tetris. While Tetris is a timeless puzzle game focused on logic and spatial reasoning, Warrior Runner features action-packed gameplay with animated characters, enemy interactions, and real-time controls. It allows players to actively control a character, making it feel more immersive. For game developers, Warrior Runner is a better learning tool as it involves working with animations, collisions, sound, and modular code — offering more creative possibilities and expansion potential than the simpler mechanics of Tetris.

### Key Challenges in Warrior Runner : 

1. *Increasing Speed Over Time
 - The game's speed ramps up as the player survives longer, reducing reaction time and increasing difficulty progressively.

2. *Obstacle Timing & Coordination
  - Players must jump or avoid obstacles (like cacti or other objects) with precise timing. Missteps mean immediate failure.

3. *Limited Player Control
  - With only basic inputs (jump/run), the game tests reflexes and not strategy. It's a pure test of timing and focus.

4. *No Power-ups or Saves
  - There are no boosters, lives, or checkpoints. One mistake means restarting, adding pressure and tension.

5. *Endless Nature
  - The game has no defined end. It's all about survival time and high score, pushing players into a loop of self-competition.

6. *Minimal Visual Cues
  - Inspired by the minimalistic T-Rex aesthetic, this design means you rely entirely on twitch reflexes—no fancy HUDs or warnings.
